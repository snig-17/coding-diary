# 📚 Coding Diary - LeetCode Journey

> *"Code. Learn. Iterate. Grow."* 

A personal chronicle of problem-solving adventures, algorithmic insights, and continuous improvement in the world of competitive programming.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

This coding diary documents my daily journey through LeetCode problems, capturing not just solutions, but the **thought process**, **struggles**, **breakthroughs**, and **lessons learned** along the way. Each entry is a snapshot of growth - from confusion to clarity, from brute force to optimization.

## 📖 Entry Structure

Each diary entry follows a consistent format designed for maximum learning value:

```java
// DATE

/*
QUESTION:
[Problem statement and constraints]
*/

/*
MY OBSERVATIONS:
- Real-time thoughts during problem-solving
- Challenges faced and breakthrough moments  
- Tools and techniques that helped
- Time complexity considerations
*/

/*
FEEDBACK:
[Post-solution analysis and improvements]
*/

💡 Philosophy

"The goal isn't just to solve problems - it's to understand them so deeply that similar challenges become second nature. Every mistake is a lesson, every optimization is growth, and every solved problem is a step toward mastery."

Core Principles

Process over result - Document the journey
Growth mindset - Embrace challenges and failures
Community learning - Share knowledge and seek feedback
Consistent practice - Daily commitment to improvement
Reflection-driven - Learn from every experience
