# 📚 Coding Diary

> _"Code. Learn. Iterate. Grow."_

A personal chronicle of problem-solving adventures, algorithmic insights, and continuous improvement in the world of competitive programming.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

This coding diary documents my daily journey through LeetCode problems, capturing not just solutions, but the **thought process**, **struggles**, **breakthroughs**, and **lessons learned** along the way. Each entry is a snapshot of growth - from confusion to clarity, from brute force to optimization.

## 📖 Entry Structure

Each diary entry follows a consistent format designed for maximum learning value:

```java
// DATE

/*
QUESTION:
[Problem statement and constraints]
*/

/*
MY OBSERVATIONS:
- Real-time thoughts during problem-solving
- Challenges faced and breakthrough moments
- Tools and techniques that helped
- Time complexity considerations
*/

/*
FEEDBACK:
[Post-solution analysis and improvements]
*/

[SOLUTION CODE]
🚀 Key Features
